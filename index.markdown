      <h2>Biography</h2>
    </header>
    <p>From 2021 to 2022, I worked as an independent software consultant, passionate about improving the velocity of software development. "Movement is life" - the faster you can navigate the software landscape the better. High-velocity can include some unexpected results: decisions can be refined quickly and engineers remain happy (because there is no "velocity" without "quality"). My interests then include cloud engineering (Pulumi) and build systems (Bazel).</p>

    <p>From 2017 to 2021, I have been a co-founder and CTO at Labstep. Labstep set out to make scientists more productive and creative, by providing a best-in-class electronic notebook experience <a href="//www.labstep.com">www.labstep.com</a>.</p>

    <p>Under the supervision of simulation masterminds, Mark Sansom (Oxford University) and Robert Best (NIH), I'm working on membrane protein folding. </p>

    <p>While at D. E. Shaw Research, New York City, I used ultra-long molecular dynamics simulations to identify cryptic binding pockets in previously undruggable phosphatases. </p>

    <p>I did my undergraduate work in Oxford, studying Biochemistry, earning an MBioch with honors
    and a medal from the Queen and Mick Jagger.
    My graduate project was in Groningen, Netherlands working on protein-lipid interactions, using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and the Martini model.</p>
