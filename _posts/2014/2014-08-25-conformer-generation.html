<i>Edited: update the figure after working around the RMSD alignment (rdkit  tries all the atom order permutations to find the best alignment,  rather than keep the atom order fixed, i think); removed the technical  problems paragraph. New figure.&nbsp; </i><br /><br />"Conformer generation is an art". That statement from a more senior computational chemist initially made me chuckle – I mean, how hard could that be? If computational methods are claiming to bring a lot to the table, surely conformer generation is a problem solved long ago... Oh the naive young mind ;)&nbsp; <br /><br />Let's start with a simple question here is: if we start from the native  (experimentally observed) conformation of a ligand and minimize it using two  popular ligand force-fields (UFF and MMFF), we should stay close to the  crystal structure. Is that indeed the case?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f7RKJ2Fdt20/U_zveEWxAZI/AAAAAAAAEZQ/Vs_t9MlunF8/s1600/plot_mda-rms_noh.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f7RKJ2Fdt20/U_zveEWxAZI/AAAAAAAAEZQ/Vs_t9MlunF8/s1600/plot_mda-rms_noh.png" height="212" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Figure 1</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>So that doesn't look so bad! Let's hydrogenate the structures – right now they're mixed bag.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nuYMIOXpQyg/U_zyFlOXfjI/AAAAAAAAEZc/9kqZygI6I9s/s1600/plot.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nuYMIOXpQyg/U_zyFlOXfjI/AAAAAAAAEZc/9kqZygI6I9s/s1600/plot.png" height="212" width="640" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Figure 2</span></div><br />Woops, adding hydrogens shouldn't increase the number of rotatble bonds (at least not in the conventional sense). <br /><br />MMFF appears to be doing better for ligands with large number of rotatable bonds – however, we have relatively low number of those. For ligands with 4-6 rotatable, which constitute most of the dataset, the UFF seems to be doing better. So the seeming advantage of MMFF may come just from the fact that we have a small number of compounds with large number of rotatable bonds.<br /><br />Neither MMFF nor UFF correctly account for the trans/cis orientation of amides. This may or may not have an impact on this benchmark, depends how many amide-containing compounds are in this set (if there are none, even if correct amide handling is introduced there will be no change to the plots above).<br /><br />Another question is what if we start from a random conformation (a more real-life problem). How likely would the UFF/MMFF minimization yield a conformer close to what's observed in a crystal?<br /><br />The silent assumption here is that the experimentally observed conformers, predominantly from crystal structures, are correct. <a href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2014/06/09/hosedup_xray_structures_a_big_problem.php">That's often not true</a>. <br /><br />If one wishes to, say, write a docking code getting those 'simple things' such as conformer generation right is critical. If that's wrong, even if you have an 'ideal scoring function' (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3793897/">if such thing exists...</a>) and an ideal sampling scheme won't get you all the way. <br /><br />Many thanks to JP for providing his set, here is <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ci2004658">JP's paper</a> on conformer generation.<br /><br />
