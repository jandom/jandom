Fraction of native contacts is a pretty darn good coordinate for looking at protein folding, definitely when it comes to small proteins. Just have a look:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/44/17874.abstract">http://www.pnas.org/content/110/44/17874.abstract</a><br /><br />Fraction of native contacts can be used to analyze long, unbiased MD runs – like those from DESRES – or in biasing simulations. But how does it fare when used in biasing? Well I don't know – but you can now find out by yourself! Either in umbrella sampling or metadynamics – or a method of your choice that doesn't use energy as your collective variable.<br /><br />Here, I'm happy to report that I incorporated an implementation of native contact CV into plumed2 – an enhanced sampling package that can be used with a number of popular MD simulation engines. The pull request is now closed <a href="https://github.com/plumed/plumed2/pull/177">https://github.com/plumed/plumed2/pull/177</a> and it's likely that the next release of plumed2 will include this.<br /><br />"Tutorial" is a regression test in plumed2 sources &nbsp;<code>regtest/basic/rt29/ </code>which shows a simple plumed input for a trp-cage protein.<br /><br />Credits: Robert Best for writing the original gromacs-only implementation, Wenwei Zheng for the draft plumed2 implementation, Giovanni Bussi for code review and feedback.<br /><br /><b>Edited</b>&nbsp;clarified some points, cleaned-up, post still needs a re-structure
