# Intro

What platform to use when blogging? And why?
What do to when your choice was a mistake and you have to migrate?
How to keep your data, the precious posts you wrote, and get the hell out to some greener pastures?
Finally, which pastures to choose and why?

# How did we get here?

It was mid 2012 and looking for a blogging platform I picked Blogger.
Seemed legit, backed by Google, it sounded like a reasonable guess.
Sure, some things were off â€“ like including code samples, but hey, nothing I couldn't hack around.
As years rolled on, it became clear that this in not the sweetheart to the powers that be.
The blogger platform was abandoned, receiving few updates and falling further behind than competition.
I wanted out but I didn't know how.
Meanwhile, together with some friends at the Hack'n'Tell I saw Jekyll being used to manage a static website.
It did the job remarkably will and was super-simple.
Not caring about Ruby at all, I used it, had a productive time and wanted to pull my old Blogger posts into my new Jekyll landing page.

# Step 1: Exporting the data from Blogger

This will be a simple-enough: a 3-click operation. Start by heading for the settings

![Navigate to settings](/docs/images/posts/2019-12-27-escape-from-the-blogger-alcatraz/blogger-settings-basic.png)

Then click on 'Other'

![Navigate to 'other' settings](/docs/images/posts/2019-12-27-escape-from-the-blogger-alcatraz/blogger-settings-other.png)

Then click 'Back up Content'

![Click on the backup button, and confirm in the backup modal](/docs/images/posts/2019-12-27-escape-from-the-blogger-alcatraz/blogger-backup-modal.png)

And bam! Just like that a file called 'blog-12-27-2019.xml' lands in our Downloads folder. Step 1 is done.

# Step 2: Convert the Blogger data into Jekyll posts

# Step 3: Adding a collection
