Just visited an old-favourite blog of mine – the excellent "In the pipeline" by Derek Lowe.<br /><br />By going though the last 5 or so pages, it's clear what's the hiring state in the industry that once was<br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/14/merck-cuts-chemistry">Merck Cuts Chemistry</a><br /><a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/08/01/layoffs-at-takeda">Layoffs at Takeda</a><br /><a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/07/20/11623">AstraZeneca Cutting Back Again</a><br /><a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/07/15/layoffs-at-medimmune">Layoffs at Medimmune</a><br /><br />To balance that there was one positive news<br /><a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/07/20/merck-expanding-on-the-west-coast">Merck Expanding on the West Coast</a><br /><br />The blog posts are for the span between July 2016 and Sept 2016.<br /><br />Now, this is no hard numbers but gives me an "anecdotal nudge" that field/industry is in atrophy. When is the last time you saw any of the computer-science shops with similar headlines? "Google cuts down on software engineers", "Facebook re-organizes and lays-off data scientists", &nbsp;anybody? It simply doesn't happen, not at this scale.<br /><br />If you're a young student, grad or post grad in life sciences, consider your options carefully. Academia is marred with fierce competition over small resources. There is a saying in starcraf2 "when ahead, get more ahead" – when you know how to code, get better at how you code.
