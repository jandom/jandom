It's my first encounter with Redux (which is an implementation of Flux). Coming from a PHP/Symfony2 background, things appear pretty different at first. The core ideas of Redux are Actions, ActionCreator and the Store - all very different vocab from what the PHP-folks are used to.<br /><br />However, things are not as different as they appear to be. Inspired by this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcnJcQ1vg_U">video</a> here is a pocket translator for what these things are in PHP-speak.<br /><br /><b>Actions</b><br />The closest match are Requests, they carry an action type (equivalent of a URI) and possibly some payload (Request post/get params)<br /><br /><b>ActionTypes</b><br />One-to-one match with 'Routes'<br /><br /><b>Store</b><br />Only one per application, it's a bit like a Routing component that gets requests, and basing on their URI types, assigns which Controller to send it to. <br /><br /><b>Reducers</b><br />Sort of like controllers, they recieve Actions from the Store and perform the following function<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">newState = reducer(oldState, action)</blockquote><br />So it's all quite simple really!
