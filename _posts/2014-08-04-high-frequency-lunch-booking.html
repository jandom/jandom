It's summer time and a 750-year-old tradition is that Merton college SCR (the senior common room) opens up its lunch sittings to the MCR members (middle common room). It's quite a treat â€“ the quality of the meal greatly surpasses what MCR members get in other times of the year.<br /><br />There is a catch obviously: the number of seats available to the MCR members is limited. The seats become available some time between Fri-Monday each week. Nobody has the time to sit there and keep refreshing the page so why not use a simple python web-crawler, executed periodically from crontab to maximize your odds of getting a spot?<br /><br />Source code is attached! Enjoy ;)&nbsp; <br /><a href="https://www.blogger.com/goog_1577307184"><br /></a><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzI3NK6qw0lJU194UzJLQkRvREU/edit?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzI3NK6qw0lJU194UzJLQkRvREU/edit?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />EDIT: Due to popular demand from college folks, the tool has been converted to web app. It's called, HackAHall and it's available (invite only) here ;)<br /><br />http://ec2-54-77-167-25.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/app.php/<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Jan
